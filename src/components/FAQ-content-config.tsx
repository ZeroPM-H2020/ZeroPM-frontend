      <p>
        ZeroPM is a research project funded by EU’s research and innovation funding programme,
        Horizon 2020. ZeroPM will enable the EU Green Deal’s ambition towards Zero Pollution of
        Persistent, Mobile Substances. ZeroPM will interlink Prevention, Prioritization, and Removal
        strategies to achieve its goals. ZeroPM will look at subgroups of PMT/vPvM substances
        including PFAS, trazines and triazoles. ZeroPM’s multidisciplinary team has expertise within
        physical, life, social and behavioural sciences, policy and communication. Together with
        stakeholders, ZeroPM will develop, explore, and critically evaluate strategies to Prevent,
        Prioritize and Remove persistent and mobile substances from the environment. ZeroPM’s
        overall objective is: To establish an evidence-based multilevel framework for minimising
        use, emissions, and pollution from persistent and mobile substances to protect European
        water resources and avoid risks to humans.{" "}

    title: "What are persistent, mobile and toxic substances?",
    content: (
      <p>
        Persistent, mobile, and toxic substances (PMTs) represent a class of chemical compounds
        characterized by three key attributes that collectively pose significant environmental and
        human health concerns.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Persistence: PMTs exhibit a remarkable resistance to degradation processes in the
            environment, persisting over extended periods without undergoing significant breakdown
            into simpler, less harmful constituents. This persistence leads to their accumulation in
            environmental matrices and biological organisms, a phenomenon known as bioaccumulation,
            with potential long-term consequences for ecosystems and human populations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mobility: PMTs possess the ability to traverse various environmental compartments,
            including air, water, and soil, enabling their widespread dispersion over geographic
            scales. This inherent mobility facilitates their transport across different
            environmental media, increasing the likelihood of exposure to ecosystems and human
            populations far removed from their original sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Toxicity: PMTs are characterized by their potent toxicity at low concentrations,
            exerting adverse effects on the health and viability of living organisms, including
            humans. The toxicological profiles of PMTs vary widely, encompassing a spectrum of
            health endpoints ranging from acute effects to chronic conditions such as developmental
            disorders, carcinogenesis, and neurotoxicity. The deleterious effects of PMTs underscore
            the imperative of stringent regulatory measures and risk management strategies to
            mitigate their environmental release and minimize human exposure.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Examples of PMTs include certain pesticides, heavy metals such as mercury and lead, select
        persistent organic pollutants (POPs) like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and various
        industrial chemicals. Understanding the persistence, mobility, and toxicity of PMTs is
        fundamental to addressing their environmental impact and safeguarding human health in the
        face of ongoing anthropogenic activities and industrial processes.
